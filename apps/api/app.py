# regardless of keepalives (verified with the LLM-free /admin/stream-test probe:
# clean EOF after ~3 pings — every client, no deploy in flight, no app restart).
# The app can't prevent that, so streams are RESUMABLE instead: every streaming
# run buffers its events here under a run_id, and GET /stream/{run_id}?since=N
# replays the buffer from any cursor and follows live. The FE reconnects
# silently on any drop, so an edge cut becomes a sub-second blip instead of an
# error. The buffer is per-replica process memory: with numReplicas>1 a resume
# can land on a replica that never saw the run (404) — the FE retries (each
# attempt re-rolls the replica) and ultimately falls back to /sessions polling,
# which reads the cross-replica store.
