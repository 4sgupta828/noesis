"""Generic, domain-neutral core DTOs — the anti-anchor.

These are the shapes that flow through the kernel pipeline. They carry a generic
`facets` bag (dimension→value) instead of named domain columns, so porting an
algorithm from a domain-specific system can never smuggle domain-specific column
names into the kernel. A vertical decides what facet keys mean; the kernel only
ever does `facets.get(k)` / `facets ⊇ filter`.
