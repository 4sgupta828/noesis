"""VerticalManifest — the single object a vertical package exposes.

A deployment activates exactly one vertical (O3). The kernel discovers installed
verticals via the `noesis.verticals` entry-point group and builds its registries
from the manifest — no kernel edits per vertical.

Slots are TYPED against contract/protocols.py (not `Any`), so `VerticalConformance`
can assert structural conformance and a new domain cannot be bolted on with a
mis-shaped component. Slots are Optional/empty so a partial manifest is valid in
early phases; conformance enforces completeness per phase.
