"""QuestionContract — Evidence Contract stage 3 (kernel-generic mechanics).

A contract describes the SHAPE of evidence a question requires: `mode` — "enumerative" (the
question demands enumerating concrete candidate items) vs "exploratory" (today's behavior) —
plus the candidate `entities` and the required evidence `axes`. This module owns MECHANICS
only: one small derivation call, structural expansion into retrieval legs, and computable
entity↔claim slot matching. ALL domain vocabulary (which items a practitioner would consider,
which safety/interaction axes matter) lives in the VERTICAL's derivation prompt, supplied via
the manifest — the kernel litmus holds: a legal vertical reuses this file untouched.

Fail-safe (Rule 18): no prompt / LLM error / malformed or abstained output → None → the caller
keeps today's exploratory behavior byte-identical. The LLM owns the semantic judgment (what to
enumerate, which axes are required); code owns the structural expansion + containment checks.
