"""Generic ReAct research loop — domain-free mechanics.

search → observe → … → answer, bounded by the cost governor, with the provenance
hard gate applied to every emitted claim: a claim survives only if its verbatim
`quote` exists at its cited atom's locator (else it's rejected — no fabrication).

The LLM decides each step via a structured `AgentStep` (the kernel's LLM port is
structured-output, so no bespoke tool-use protocol is needed). Domain vocabulary,
the system prompt, and richer gating (the 10th-seam policy) come from the vertical
in P3; here the mechanics are proven offline with a scripted FakeLLM.
