"""Suggested follow-up questions — propose a few next questions that deepen discovery.

After an answer, suggest 3–4 questions the user could ask next to go deeper: understand the
mechanism/evidence better, explore an adjacent angle, or move toward action. The domain framing
(what "deeper discovery, understanding, and action" means here) lives entirely in the vertical's
`suggest_prompt`; the kernel owns only the mechanics. These are QUESTIONS, not answers — asking
one runs the normal grounded loop, so nothing here bypasses the grounding invariant.
