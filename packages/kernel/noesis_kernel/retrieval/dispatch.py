"""Multi-query retrieval dispatch — the recall booster (parity with factra).

Runs the original query plus agent-generated reformulations against a source and
fuses across them with weighted RRF: the original query weighs more, and a block
retrieved by multiple variants gets a repeat bonus. Mirrors factra's dispatcher
(original weight 1.5, repeat bonus 0.15) — kept in the kernel, engine-agnostic.
Reformulation itself is the agent's job (LLM); this fuses the results.
